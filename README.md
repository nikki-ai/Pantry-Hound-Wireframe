# Pantry-Hound-Wireframe

Summary
This app will let you log all of your houshold foods and their calorie count and set a daily calorie limit for yourself.
When you press a button "Fetch my food" It will give you a list of your available foods and the amount of servings you 
could eat of that specific food before you were to reach your cal. limit. 
As the day goes on and you are closer to your cal. limit the list gets more refined.
